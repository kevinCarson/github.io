I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona’s School of Sociology, where I previously earned a Master of Arts in Sociology. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Sociology from the University of South Carolina.

My research broadly explores the dynamics within covert and illicit social worlds. Specifically, I focus on the social dynamics of undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border and the conflict dynamics among organized criminal groups in Mexico. To analyze these complex social processes, I utilize sociological and criminological theories and employ statistical network models—such as the relational event model—as well as standard regression techniques, including logistic regression.

I am a strong advocate for open science and am committed to reducing barriers to knowledge dissemination. To this end, I make all code for replicating analyses from my peer-reviewed articles publicly available. I also share teaching materials on statistical models, aiming to facilitate access to scientific resources. Any errors in my work are my own
