title: "Teaching Posts and Blogs"

On the occasion, I like to make blog posts about *fun with statistics* that are geared to spreading statistical knowledge in a fun way. For the better part, most of the blog posts will discuss methods for social network analysis. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you notice any errors.
